    <p>
        The purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate how thermal energy from candles can be converted 
        into mechanical motion through the process of convection. Understanding this energy transformation is 
        important because it illustrates fundamental physics principles that apply to many real-world applications, 
        including wind turbines, hot air balloons, and heating systems. By studying candle carousels, we can 
        observe how differences in air temperature create forces that produce motion.

    <h2>Importance and Applicability</h2>
    
    <p>
        This experiment demonstrates a fundamental principle of physics: energy transformation. Thermal energy 
        (heat) from the candles is converted into kinetic energy (motion) through convection currents. This 
        principle has numerous real-world applications:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wind Turbines:</strong> Convert air movement into rotational motion to generate electricity</li>
        <li><strong>Hot Air Balloons:</strong> Use rising hot air to provide lift</li>
        <li><strong>Heating Systems:</strong> Rely on convection to distribute warm air throughout buildings</li>
        <li><strong>Weather Systems:</strong> Large-scale convection drives weather patterns as warm air rises and cold air sinks</li>
        <li><strong>Convection Ovens:</strong> Use circulating hot air to cook food evenly</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        By understanding how candle carousels work, we gain insight into these larger systems and the 
        fundamental physics that govern energy transfer in our world.
