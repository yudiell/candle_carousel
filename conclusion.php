    <h2>1️⃣ Answer to the Research Question</h2>
    
    <p>
        The number of candles significantly affects the rotational speed of a candle carousel. Based on the 
        experimental data, the carousel rotates [faster/slower/at varying speeds] as more candles are added.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The research question "How does the number of candles affect the rotational speed of a candle carousel?" 
        can be answered by stating that [insert your specific findings based on your data].

    <h2>2️⃣ Supporting Evidence</h2>
    
    <p>
        The data table shows that with 1 candle, the average speed was [X] RPM, while with 4 candles, the 
        average speed increased to [Y] RPM. The graph clearly illustrates [describe the trend shown in the 
        graph]. This represents a [calculate percentage] increase in rotational speed.

        [Describe the range of variation between trials, any anomalies in the data, and the consistency of 
        results. For example: "The standard deviation across trials was small, indicating consistent results. 
        The R² value of the trend line was [value], suggesting a strong correlation between number of candles 
        and rotation speed."]

    </ul>
    
    <h2>4️⃣ Scientific Explanation</h2>
    
    <p>
        This data supports the hypothesis because more candles produce more thermal energy, which heats a larger 
        volume of air. The increased heat creates stronger convection currents with greater upward velocity. When 
        this faster-moving warm air strikes the angled blades, it exerts a greater force, resulting in increased 
        rotational speed.
    </p>
    
    <h3>🌍 Real-World Applications</h3>
    
    <p>
        This principle applies to other real-world phenomena:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>🌬️ Wind Turbines:</strong> Like the carousel, wind turbines convert air movement into rotational 
            motion, though they use natural wind rather than convection currents. The same principle of angled blades 
            converting air flow into rotation applies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>🎈 Hot Air Balloons:</strong> Rising hot air provides lift, similar to how it provides force to 
            spin the carousel. Both rely on the principle that hot air is less dense and rises.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>🔥 Convection Ovens:</strong> Hot air circulation distributes heat evenly, using the same principle 
            of hot air rising and cold air sinking. The convection currents ensure even cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>🌤️ Weather Systems:</strong> Large-scale convection currents drive weather patterns as warm air rises 
            and cold air sinks. Understanding convection helps meteorologists predict weather patterns.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5️⃣ Hypothesis Evaluation</h2>

        <p style="margin: 0;">
            <strong>[If hypothesis was correct:]</strong> The hypothesis was supported by the experimental data. 
            As predicted, increasing the number of candles did result in faster rotation speeds due to stronger 
            convection currents.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 0;">
            <strong>[If hypothesis was incorrect:]</strong> The hypothesis was not fully supported. [Explain what 
            you learned—for example: "While rotation speed did increase from 1 to 3 candles, adding a 4th candle 
            did not significantly increase the speed further. This may be because the maximum force on the blades 
            was reached, or because heat from 4 candles interfered with the convection pattern."]

        <h3>📝 Summary</h3>
        <p>
            This experiment successfully demonstrated how thermal energy from candles can be converted into 
            mechanical motion through convection. The results show a clear relationship between the number of 
            heat sources (candles) and the resulting motion (rotation speed), illustrating fundamental physics 
            principles that apply to many real-world technologies and natural phenomena.
