# Title

This page is for the title of your science fair project.
You should not add any other information to this slide.

---

# Purpose:

State the purpose for the experiment. In your first sentence you must clearly explain why you conducted this experiment. Start this sentence with "The purpose of this experiment was to." As you finish the sentence, make the importance and applicability of your experiment clear to readers.

---

# Background Research:

Background research can be gathered sources such as books, magazines, journals, newspapers, online documents, or literature from non-profit organizations. Don't forget to make a record of any resource used so that credit can be given in a bibliography or works cited page.

---

# Question:

The question must be written so that it is researchable through experimentation. Do not forget the question mark.

---

# Hypothesis:

The hypothesis should answer the question. Make sure that you write your hypothesis in an if - then - because format.

---

# Variables:

- **Independent Variable:** The one variable the investigator chooses to change. (What is changed?)

- **Dependent Variable:** The variable that changes as a result of -or in response to- the independent variable. (What you measure?)

- **Constant Variables:** The variables that are kept the same each time. (What stays the same?)

# Materials:

List here the materials that you are going to need to do your experiment or research.

---

# Procedures:

Write here how you are going to do your experiment step by step.

---

# Pictures:

Insert pictures here Insert pictures here

---

# Data:

Add a data table that will display the data that you gathered during your experiment. Be sure that you list any measurements using the correct metric units.

---

# Graph:

Create a graph that shows the data that you collected. Be sure and label your graph correctly and use the correct metric units.

---

# Result:

Conduct the appropriate statistical analysis of your data. This will show if your findings are or make a significant difference.

---

# Conclusion:

Make sure that when you write your conclusion that you include:

1. Answer the 'research question'...this is your claim
2. Write down the supporting evidence and tell where the reader can find it...on your graph, in the data table even pictures can be referred to if they are included.
3. Include statistical analysis of the data here.
4. Explain how the data supports your answer. Give examples of how this applies to other phenomenon.
5. If your hypothesis was incorrect explain what you learned from this project.
