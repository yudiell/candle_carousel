# How Candle Carousels Convert Heat Energy into Motion

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate how thermal energy from candles can be converted into mechanical motion through the process of convection. Understanding this energy transformation is important because it illustrates fundamental physics principles that apply to many real-world applications, including wind turbines, hot air balloons, and heating systems. By studying candle carousels, we can observe how differences in air temperature create forces that produce motion.

## Background Research

Candle carousels, also known as Christmas pyramids or candle pyramids, originated in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) region of Germany during the 18th century. Miners in this region created simple versions of these devices to take into the mines as a source of light and as an indicator that oxygen was present (since candles need oxygen to burn). Over time, these practical tools evolved into decorative items used during Christmas celebrations.

The science behind candle carousels involves convection, which is the transfer of heat through the movement of fluids (liquids or gases). When a candle burns, it heats the air directly above it. Hot air is less dense than cold air, causing it to rise. This creates a convection current as warm air rises, cools, and falls back down. When the rising hot air encounters the tilted blades of a carousel, it exerts a force on them. Because the blades are angled, this upward force is converted into a sideways push, creating lift and causing the carousel to spin.

The force exerted by the rising air is similar to how wind turbines work, except that in a candle carousel, the "wind" is created by heat rather than natural air movement. The angle of the blades is crucial—if they are too flat, heat accumulates underneath without rising efficiently; if they are too vertical, the heat escapes too quickly without pushing the blades effectively.

## Question

How does the number of candles affect the rotational speed of a candle carousel?

---

## Hypothesis

If more candles are placed under the candle carousel, then the carousel will spin faster, because more candles produce more heat energy, which creates stronger convection currents that exert greater force on the carousel blades.

## Procedures

1. **Build the carousel base:**

   - Cut or use a flat, stable base approximately 20-25 cm in diameter
   - Mark positions for 4 candles evenly spaced around the center (about 6-8 cm from center)
   - Secure clay or playdough at each marked position to hold candles

2. **Create the center axle:**

   - Push the wooden skewer vertically through the center of the base
   - Ensure the skewer stands perfectly vertical (check from all sides)
   - The skewer should extend 15-20 cm above the base
   - Secure at the bottom with clay or by mounting in a small nut

3. **Construct the carousel blades:**

   - Cut a circle from aluminum foil or pie pan (approximately 12-15 cm diameter)
   - Mark the center point of the circle
   - Divide the circle into 6-8 equal sections by drawing lines from edge toward center
   - Cut along the lines, stopping about 1-2 cm from the center
   - Carefully bend each section at an angle of 30-40 degrees (measure with protractor)
   - All blades should be bent in the same direction (clockwise or counterclockwise)
   - Poke a small hole in the center

4. **Assemble the carousel:**

   - Place a small metal nut or bead on top of the skewer as a bearing
   - Carefully place the blade assembly on top of the nut/bearing
   - Ensure the blades can spin freely without touching the skewer or wobbling
   - The blades should be positioned 8-12 cm above where the candle flames will be

5. **Conduct the experiment:**

   - Test 1: Place 1 candle on the base and light it
   - Wait 30 seconds for convection currents to establish
   - Count the number of complete rotations in 1 minute
   - Record the data
   - Blow out the candle and wait 2 minutes for air to settle

6. **Repeat with different numbers of candles:**

   - Test 2: Place 2 candles opposite each other, light them, and repeat measurement
   - Test 3: Place 3 candles evenly spaced, light them, and repeat measurement
   - Test 4: Place 4 candles evenly spaced, light them, and repeat measurement

7. **Conduct multiple trials:**

   - Repeat the entire experiment 3 times for each candle configuration
   - Calculate the average rotations per minute for each configuration

8. **Safety precautions:**
   - Conduct experiment on a non-flammable surface
   - Keep paper and flammable materials away from candles
   - Never leave burning candles unattended
   - Have adult supervision at all times
   - Keep hands away from the area above the flames (hot air can cause burns)
   - Ensure the room has adequate ventilation

## Result

After conducting the statistical analysis of the data collected, the results show [describe whether there was a significant increase in rotation speed with more candles, or if results were different than expected].

The carousel achieved the highest rotation speed with [number] candles, averaging [number] RPM. The lowest speed occurred with [number] candle(s), averaging [number] RPM.

The data demonstrates that [describe the relationship between number of candles and rotation speed—was it linear, exponential, or something else?]. The percentage increase in speed from 1 candle to 4 candles was [calculate and insert percentage].

---

## Conclusion

**1. Answer to the research question:**

The number of candles significantly affects the rotational speed of a candle carousel. Based on the experimental data, the carousel rotates [faster/slower/at varying speeds] as more candles are added.

**2. Supporting evidence:**

The data table shows that with 1 candle, the average speed was [X] RPM, while with 4 candles, the average speed increased to [Y] RPM. The graph clearly illustrates [describe the trend shown in the graph]. This represents a [calculate percentage] increase in rotational speed.

**3. Statistical analysis:**

[Describe the range of variation between trials, any anomalies in the data, and the consistency of results. For example: "The standard deviation across trials was small, indicating consistent results. The R² value of the trend line was [value], suggesting a strong correlation between number of candles and rotation speed."]

**4. Scientific explanation:**

This data supports the hypothesis because more candles produce more thermal energy, which heats a larger volume of air. The increased heat creates stronger convection currents with greater upward velocity. When this faster-moving warm air strikes the angled blades, it exerts a greater force, resulting in increased rotational speed.

This principle applies to other real-world phenomena:

- **Wind turbines:** Like the carousel, wind turbines convert air movement into rotational motion, though they use natural wind rather than convection currents
- **Hot air balloons:** Rising hot air provides lift, similar to how it provides force to spin the carousel
- **Convection ovens:** Hot air circulation distributes heat evenly, using the same principle of hot air rising and cold air sinking
- **Weather systems:** Large-scale convection currents drive weather patterns as warm air rises and cold air sinks

**5. Hypothesis evaluation:**

[If hypothesis was correct:] The hypothesis was supported by the experimental data. As predicted, increasing the number of candles did result in faster rotation speeds due to stronger convection currents.

[If hypothesis was incorrect:] The hypothesis was not fully supported. [Explain what you learned—for example: "While rotation speed did increase from 1 to 3 candles, adding a 4th candle did not significantly increase the speed further. This may be because the maximum force on the blades was reached, or because heat from 4 candles interfered with the convection pattern."]

**Key learnings from this project:**

- Heat energy can be converted into mechanical motion through convection
- The angle of the blades is critical for converting upward air movement into rotational motion
- More heat sources create stronger convection currents
- This demonstrates the principle of energy transformation (thermal to kinetic energy)

## What I Would Do Next

To further investigate this topic, I would explore:

1. **Testing different blade angles:** Experiment with blade angles from 20° to 50° to find the optimal angle for maximum rotation speed

2. **Investigating blade materials:** Compare the performance of blades made from different materials (aluminum foil, cardstock paper, thin plastic) to determine which material provides the best balance of weight and surface area

3. **Varying the distance:** Test how the distance between the candles and blades affects rotation speed (heights of 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm, and 20 cm)

4. **Exploring blade design:** Create different blade shapes (rectangular, curved, or twisted) to see which design captures the rising air most efficiently

5. **Measuring actual temperatures:** Use a thermometer to measure the temperature of air at different heights above the candles to quantify the relationship between temperature and rotation speed

6. **Testing candle size:** Compare tea light candles with larger candles to determine if flame size affects rotation speed more than the number of candles

7. **Investigating air flow patterns:** Use smoke or lightweight tissue paper to visualize the convection currents and understand the air flow patterns better

8. **Creating a multi-tier carousel:** Build a carousel with multiple levels to see if they all rotate at the same speed or if higher levels rotate differently

## Additional Information

### Historical Context

German Christmas pyramids (Weihnachtspyramiden) have a rich history dating back to the 16th-18th centuries in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) region of Germany. During the 18th century, this area was a thriving mining community where miners created simple pyramid structures with candles to use in dark mines. These early versions served two practical purposes: providing light and indicating that sufficient oxygen was present (since candles require oxygen to burn).

The pyramid shape was essential for safety—the wider base prevented the entire structure from catching fire as heat rose to the narrower top. Over time, miners began decorating their pyramids with hand-carved wooden figurines, and these decorative versions moved from the mines into homes as Christmas decorations.

As the mining industry declined in the 19th century, mining families in the Erzgebirge region turned to woodcraft as their primary source of income. This led to the development of more elaborate Christmas pyramids with multiple tiers, intricate carvings, and sophisticated rotating mechanisms. Today, these handcrafted pyramids are treasured Christmas decorations passed down through generations, and the Erzgebirge region remains famous for its traditional wooden crafts including pyramids, nutcrackers, and smokers.

### The Science of Convection

Convection is one of three methods of heat transfer (along with conduction and radiation). In convection, heat moves through the movement of fluids—either liquids or gases.

When air is heated:

1. The air molecules gain energy and move faster
2. The air expands and becomes less dense
3. The less dense (warmer) air rises above the denser (cooler) air
4. As the warm air rises and moves away, cooler air moves in to replace it
5. This creates a continuous circulation called a convection current

In a candle carousel:

- The candle flame heats the air directly above it to temperatures significantly higher than room temperature
- This hot air rises rapidly upward
- When the rising air encounters the angled blades, it cannot continue straight upward
- The angle of the blades redirects the upward force into a sideways (horizontal) force
- This sideways force is called "lift" and causes the blades to rotate
- As the blades rotate, they continue to encounter fresh rising hot air, maintaining continuous motion

The efficiency of this system depends on:

- **Blade angle:** 30-40 degrees is optimal for converting vertical air movement to horizontal rotation
- **Heat intensity:** More heat creates faster-moving air and greater force
- **Blade surface area:** Larger blades catch more air but also add weight
- **Weight distribution:** Lighter materials spin more easily
- **Air flow patterns:** Interference from room air currents can disrupt the convection system
