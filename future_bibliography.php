    <h2>What I Would Do Next</h2>
    
    <p>
        To further investigate this topic and extend the experiment, I would explore the following research directions:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Testing different blade angles:</strong> Experiment with blade angles from 20° to 50° to find 
            the optimal angle for maximum rotation speed. This would help determine if the current 30-40 degree 
            range is truly optimal or if other angles might be more efficient.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Investigating blade materials:</strong> Compare the performance of blades made from different 
            materials (aluminum foil, cardstock paper, thin plastic) to determine which material provides the 
            best balance of weight and surface area. Lighter materials might spin faster, while sturdier materials 
            might maintain their shape better.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Varying the distance:</strong> Test how the distance between the candles and blades affects 
            rotation speed (heights of 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm, and 20 cm). This would help determine the optimal 
            positioning for maximum efficiency.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Exploring blade design:</strong> Create different blade shapes (rectangular, curved, or twisted) 
            to see which design captures the rising air most efficiently. Different shapes might create different 
            air flow patterns and affect rotation speed.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Measuring actual temperatures:</strong> Use a thermometer to measure the temperature of air at 
            different heights above the candles to quantify the relationship between temperature and rotation speed. 
            This would provide more precise data about the convection currents.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Testing candle size:</strong> Compare tea light candles with larger candles to determine if flame 
            size affects rotation speed more than the number of candles. This would help understand whether total heat 
            output or heat distribution is more important.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Investigating air flow patterns:</strong> Use smoke or lightweight tissue paper to visualize the 
            convection currents and understand the air flow patterns better. This would provide visual evidence of 
            how the air moves and interacts with the blades.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Creating a multi-tier carousel:</strong> Build a carousel with multiple levels to see if they all 
            rotate at the same speed or if higher levels rotate differently. This would explore how convection currents 
            change with height and whether multiple blade levels can be powered by the same heat source.
        </li>
    </ol>
